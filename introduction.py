"""-Machine Learning  often  abbreviated as ML, is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
that works on algorithm developments and statistical models that allow computers to learn from 
data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
-Machine learning focuses primarily on the creation of algorithms that enable a computer to 
independently learn from data and previous experiences.
-For the purpose of developing predictive models, machine learning brings 
together statistics and computer science. 
-Algorithms that learn from historical data are either constructed or utilized 
in machine learning. The performance will rise in proportion to the quantity of information we provide."""

'''Features of Machine Learning:
1.Machine learning uses data to detect various patterns in a given dataset.
2.It can learn from past data and improve automatically.
3.It is a data-driven technology.
4.Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.'''
