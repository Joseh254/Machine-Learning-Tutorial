"""-Machine Learning  often  abbreviated as ML, is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
that works on algorithm developments and statistical models that allow computers to learn from 
data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
-Machine learning focuses primarily on the creation of algorithms that enable a computer to 
independently learn from data and previous experiences.
