"""-Machine Learning  often  abbreviated as ML, is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
that works on algorithm developments and statistical models that allow computers to learn from 
data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
-Machine learning focuses primarily on the creation of algorithms that enable a computer to 
independently learn from data and previous experiences.
-For the purpose of developing predictive models, machine learning brings 
together statistics and computer science. 
-Algorithms that learn from historical data are either constructed or utilized 
in machine learning. The performance will rise in proportion to the quantity of information we provide."""
