'''Data preprocessing is the process of evaluating, filtering, manipulating, 
and encoding data so that a machine learning algorithm can understand it and use the resulting output. 
-The major goal of data preprocessing is to eliminate data issues such as :
  -missing values, 
  -improve data quality and 
  -make the data useful for machine learning purposes.

  Importance of Data Preprocessing 

  As the adage goes, “If garbage goes in, garbage comes out.” 
  -Your data project will only be as successful as the input 
  data you feed into your machine learning algorithms.
  1.It Improves Data Quality
Data preprocessing is the fast track to improving data quality since many of its steps mirror activities
 you’ll find in any data quality management process, such as data cleansing, data profiling,
data integration, and more.
