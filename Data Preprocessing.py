'''Data preprocessing is the process of evaluating, filtering, manipulating, 
and encoding data so that a machine learning algorithm can understand it and use the resulting output. 
-The major goal of data preprocessing is to eliminate data issues such as :
  -missing values, 
  -improve data quality and 
  -make the data useful for machine learning purposes.
