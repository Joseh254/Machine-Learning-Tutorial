'''                   Supervised Machine Learning

-Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine
 learning model.
-The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input
  variable(x) with the output variable(y).
-Supervised learning is the type of machine learning in which machines are trained using 
well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. 
-The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.
