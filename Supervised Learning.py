'''                   Supervised Machine Learning

-Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine
 learning model.
-The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input
  variable(x) with the output variable(y).
-Supervised learning is the type of machine learning in which machines are trained using 
well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. 
-The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.


Example:

Let’s say you have a fruit basket that you want to identify. The machine would first analyze the image to
 extract features such as its shape, color, and texture. Then, it would compare these features to the 
 features of the fruits it has already learned about. If the new image’s features are most similar
  to those of an apple, the machine would predict that the fruit is an apple.

For instance, suppose you are given a basket filled with different kinds of fruits. Now the first step is to train the machine with all the different fruits one by one like this: 

If the shape of the object is rounded and has a depression at the top, is red in color, then it will be labeled as –Apple.
If the shape of the object is a long curving cylinder having Green-Yellow color, then it will be labeled as –Banana.

                 How Supervised Learning Works
 1.Models are trained using labelled dataset  
 2.The model is tested on the basis of test data
 3.The model then  predicts the output.
