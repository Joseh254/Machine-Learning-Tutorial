'''Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear 
relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear 
equation to observed data.
-When there is only one independent feature, it is known as Simple Linear Regression, and
 when there are more than one feature, it is known as Multiple Linear Regression.
 -Similarly, when there is only one dependent variable, it is considered Univariate Linear Regression, 
 while when there are more than one dependent variables, it is known as Multivariate Regression.
