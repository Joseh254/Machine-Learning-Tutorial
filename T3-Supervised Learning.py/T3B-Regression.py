'''Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear 
relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear 
equation to observed data.
-When there is only one independent feature, it is known as Simple Linear Regression, and
 when there are more than one feature, it is known as Multiple Linear Regression.
 -Similarly, when there is only one dependent variable, it is considered Univariate Linear Regression, 
 while when there are more than one dependent variables, it is known as Multivariate Regression.

           Types of Linear Regression
  1. Simple Linear Regression 
      
  -This is the simplest form of linear regression, and it involves only one independent variable and 
  one dependent variable. The equation for simple linear regression is:   
  y=β0 +β1 X
  where:
Y is the dependent variable
X is the independent variable
β0 is the intercept
β1 is the slope
